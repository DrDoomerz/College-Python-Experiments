# Experiment 1: Introduction to Python

## Aim

To gain an introduction to the Python programming language by understanding basic concepts such as variable declaration, data types, input–output operations, conditional statements, and the use of the built-in **math** package through simple programs.

## Theory

### Python Data Types Used

During this experiment, the following Python data types were used:

1. **Integer (`int`)**
   Used to store whole numbers. Example: `2`

2. **Float (`float`)**
   Used to store decimal or real numbers. Example: `2.5`, user-defined numerical inputs.

3. **String (`str`)**
   Used to store textual data. Example: `"rachit"`, `"apple"`.

4. **Boolean (`bool`)**
   Used to store logical values: `True` or `False`.

These data types form the foundation of Python programming and allow efficient handling of different kinds of data.

### Math Package in Python

Python provides a built-in module called **`math`** that contains mathematical constants and functions. In this experiment, the `math` package was used for:

* `math.pi` → To obtain the value of π (pi)
* `math.log10(x)` → To calculate the base-10 logarithm of a number

The `math` module must be imported using:

```python
import math
```

This module helps perform advanced mathematical operations easily and accurately.

## Algorithms

### 1. Variable Declaration and Assignment

**Algorithm:**

1. Declare multiple variables in a single statement.
2. Assign string values to the variables.
3. Print each variable on a new line.

### 2. Detection of Data Types

**Algorithm:**

1. Declare variables with different data types (integer, float, string, boolean).
2. Use the `type()` function to determine the data type of each variable.
3. Print the data types.

### 3. User Input and Output

**Algorithm:**

1. Ask the user to enter input values.
2. Convert the input into the required data type using type casting.
3. Display the output using the `print()` function.

### 4. Mini Calculator Using Arithmetic Operators

**Algorithm:**

1. Accept two numerical values `a` and `b` from the user.
2. Perform addition using `a + b` and display the result.
3. Perform subtraction using `a - b` and display the result.
4. Perform multiplication using `a * b` and display the result.
5. Perform division using `a / b` and display the result.
6. Perform modulus operation using `a % b`.
7. Perform exponential operation using `a ** b`.
8. Display all calculated results clearly.

### 5. Area of a Circle Using Math Library

**Algorithm:**

1. Import the `math` module.
2. Accept the radius of the circle from the user.
3. Calculate the area using the formula: π × r².
4. Display the calculated area.

### 6. Logarithmic Calculation

**Algorithm:**

1. Import the `math` module.
2. Accept a number from the user.
3. Use `math.log10()` to compute the logarithm.
4. Display the result.

---

### 7. Comparison of Two Numbers Using Conditional Statements

**Algorithm:**

1. Accept two numerical values from the user.
2. Compare the values using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
3. Display which number is greater or if both are equal.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, fundamental Python programming concepts were successfully implemented. Special emphasis was given to arithmetic operations by developing a mini calculator using operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Along with this, the experiment covered variable declaration, identification of data types, user input handling, conditional logic, and mathematical computations using the `math` library. Overall, this experiment provided a strong foundation in Python programming and logical problem-solving, which is essential for advanced applications.
