# Experiment 2: Study of Lists in Python

## Aim

To understand the concept of lists in Python and perform basic operations such as creating lists, accessing elements, modifying lists, and applying list methods.

---

## Theory

A **list** in Python is a collection of elements stored in a single variable. Lists are written using square brackets `[]` and the elements are separated by commas. A list can store values of different data types like integers, floats, strings, etc.

Important features of lists:

* Lists are ordered
* Lists are mutable (values can be changed)
* Lists allow duplicate elements
* Lists can store different data types

Example:

```python
list1 = [10, 20, "apple", True]
```

In this experiment, lists were used to perform basic operations such as indexing, inserting elements, combining lists, and sorting data.

## Algorithms

### 1. Creating and Printing a List

**Steps:**

1. Create a list with string elements.
2. Print the list using the `print()` function.

---

### 2. Creating a Mixed Data Type List

**Steps:**

1. Create a list containing integer, float, string, and boolean values.
2. Display the list.

---

### 3. Duplicate Elements in a List

**Steps:**

1. Create a list with repeated elements.
2. Print the list to show that duplicates are allowed.

---

### 4. Indexing and Slicing

**Steps:**

1. Create a list with multiple elements.
2. Access elements using index values.
3. Display the selected elements.

---

### 5. Replacing an Element in a List

**Steps:**

1. Create a list.
2. Replace an element at a specific index.
3. Print the updated list.

---

### 6. Adding an Element Using `append()`

**Steps:**

1. Create a list.
2. Add a new element at the end using `append()`.
3. Print the list.

---

### 7. Adding an Element Using `insert()`

**Steps:**

1. Create a list.
2. Insert an element at a given position.
3. Print the updated list.

---

### 8. Combining Two Lists

**Steps:**

1. Create two different lists.
2. Combine them using the `+` operator or `extend()` method.
3. Print the final list.

---

### 9. DIY 1: Marks List Program

**Steps:**

1. Take marks from the user and store them in a list.
2. Find the maximum and minimum marks.
3. Sort the list.
4. Display the results.

---

### 10. DIY 2: Grocery List Program

**Steps:**

1. Create a grocery list.
2. Add items to the list.
3. Remove items from the list.
4. Display the final grocery list.

---

## Conclusion

In this experiment, basic operations on lists were studied and implemented. The programs helped in understanding how lists are created, modified, and used in Python. The DIY programs showed how lists can be applied to real-life situations such as managing marks and grocery items. This experiment helped build a strong foundation for working with data structures in Python.
