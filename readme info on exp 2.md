# Experiment 2: Study of Lists in Python

## Aim

To study and implement the concept of **lists in Python**, including list creation, indexing, duplication, modification, insertion, combination, and basic operations on list elements.

---

## Theory

### List Data Type in Python

A **list** in Python is an ordered, mutable collection of elements. Lists can store elements of **different data types** such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Lists are written using square brackets `[]` and elements are separated by commas.

**Key characteristics of lists:**

* Ordered
* Mutable (elements can be changed)
* Allows duplicate values
* Can store mixed data types

Example:

```python
list1 = [1, 2.5, "rachit", True]
```

### Operations Performed on Lists

The following list operations were studied in this experiment:

* Creating lists
* Printing lists
* List indexing and slicing
* Replacing elements
* Adding elements using `append()` and `insert()`
* Combining lists using `+` and `extend()`
* Sorting lists

## Algorithms

### 1. Creating and Printing a List

**Algorithm:**

1. Define a list with string elements.
2. Use the `print()` function to display the list.

---

### 2. Creating an Alphanumeric List

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a list containing integers, floats, strings, and boolean values.
2. Print the list.

---

### 3. Demonstration of Duplicate Elements in a List

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a list with repeated elements.
2. Print the list to show that duplicates are allowed.

---

### 4. Indexing and Slicing of Lists

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a list with multiple elements.
2. Access elements using positive and negative indexing.
3. Extract sublists using slicing techniques.
4. Display the results.

---

### 5. Replacing an Element in a List

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a list.
2. Replace an element at a specific index.
3. Print the updated list.

---

### 6. Adding an Element Using `append()`

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a list.
2. Use `append()` to add an element at the end.
3. Print the updated list.

---

### 7. Adding an Element at a Specific Position Using `insert()`

**Algorithm:**

1. Create a list.
2. Use `insert(index, element)` to add an element at a desired position.
3. Print the updated list.

---

### 8. Combining Lists Using `+` Operator

**Algorithm:**

1. Create two separate lists.
2. Combine them using the `+` operator.
3. Print the combined list.

---

### 9. Combining Lists Using `extend()` Method

**Algorithm:**

1. Create two lists.
2. Use `extend()` to add elements of one list to another.
3. Print both lists.

---

### 10. Finding Maximum, Minimum, and Sorting Marks List (DIY)

**Algorithm:**

1. Accept marks from the user in the form of a list.
2. Use built-in functions to find the maximum and minimum marks.
3. Sort the list in ascending order.
4. Display the maximum, minimum, and sorted list.

---

### 11. Grocery List Management Program (DIY)

**Algorithm:**

1. Create an initial grocery list with predefined items.
2. Allow the user to add new items to the list.
3. Allow the user to remove unwanted items from the list.
4. Display the updated grocery list.

---

## Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrated the use of lists in Python. Various list operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, modification, insertion, duplication, and combination were implemented. The DIY problems enhanced understanding by applying list operations to real-life scenarios such as managing marks and grocery items. Overall, this experiment strengthened the understanding of Python’s list data structure and its practical applications.
