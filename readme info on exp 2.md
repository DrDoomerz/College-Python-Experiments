# Experiment 2: Study of Lists in Python

## Aim

To understand the concept of lists in Python and perform basic operations such as creating lists, accessing elements, modifying lists, and applying list methods.

---

## Theory

A **list** in Python is a collection of elements stored in a single variable. Lists are written using square brackets `[]` and the elements are separated by commas. A list can store values of different data types like integers, floats, strings, etc.

Important features of lists:

* Lists are ordered
* Lists are mutable (values can be changed)
* Lists allow duplicate elements
* Lists can store different data types

Example:

```python
list1 = [10, 20, "apple", True]
```

In this experiment, lists were used to perform basic operations such as indexing, inserting elements, combining lists, and sorting data.

## Algorithms


### DIY 1: Marks List Program

**Steps:**

1. Take marks from the user and store them in a list.
2. Find the maximum and minimum marks.
3. Sort the list.
4. Display the results.

### DIY 2: Grocery List Program

**Steps:**

1. Create a grocery list.
2. Add items to the list.
3. Remove items from the list.
4. Display the final grocery list.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, basic operations on lists were studied and implemented. The programs helped in understanding how lists are created, modified, and used in Python. The DIY programs showed how lists can be applied to real-life situations such as managing marks and grocery items. This experiment helped build a strong foundation for working with data structures in Python.
