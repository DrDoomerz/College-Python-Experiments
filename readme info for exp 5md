# Experiment 5: Study of Dictionaries in Python

## Aim

To study the concept of **dictionaries in Python** and perform operations such as storing, accessing, searching, and updating data using key–value pairs.

---

## Theory

A **dictionary** in Python is a built-in data type used to store data in the form of **key–value pairs**. Each key acts like a label, and each value is the data associated with that label. Dictionaries are written using curly braces `{}` with keys and values separated by a colon.

Example:

```
student = {"name": "Rachit", "roll": 21, "marks": 88}
```

### Key Features of Dictionaries

* **Key–Value Structure:** Every element has a key and a value.
* **Unique Keys:** No two keys can be the same. If a duplicate key is used, the latest value replaces the old one.
* **Mutable:** Values can be added, changed, or removed after creation.
* **Fast Access:** Values can be accessed quickly using their keys.
* **Mixed Data Types:** Values can be integers, strings, lists, etc.

### Common Dictionary Methods and Functions

* `dict[key]` → Access value using key
* `get(key)` → Safely access value without error if key is missing
* `keys()` → Returns all keys
* `values()` → Returns all values
* `items()` → Returns key–value pairs
* `update()` → Updates dictionary
* `pop()` → Removes an element using key
* `len()` → Finds number of items in dictionary
* `max()` → Finds maximum value (useful in marks problems)

### Why Dictionaries are Useful

Dictionaries are very useful when data must be stored with identifiers. For example:

* Student records
* Product price lists
* Login credentials
* Mark sheets

They make searching and updating data easy and efficient compared to lists.

## Algorithms (DIY Questions Only)

### DIY Problem 1: Update Product Price

**Steps:**

1. Create a dictionary with product names and prices.
2. Display the original dictionary.
3. Select the product whose price needs to be updated.
4. Assign a new price to that product using its key.
5. Display the updated dictionary.

### DIY Problem 2: Search Student Marks

**Steps:**

1. Create a dictionary with student names and marks.
2. Take student name as input.
3. Use `get()` to search for the name in the dictionary.
4. Display marks if found, otherwise show "Student not found".

### DIY Problem 3: Validate User Login

**Steps:**

1. Create a dictionary with usernames and passwords.
2. Take username and password as input.
3. Retrieve stored password using `get()`.
4. Compare entered password with stored password.
5. Display login success or failure message.

### DIY Problem 4: Find Highest Marks

**Steps:**

1. Create a dictionary with student names and marks.
2. Use `max()` with dictionary keys to find the highest scorer.
3. Retrieve the highest marks using the key.
4. Display the topper name and marks.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, dictionaries in Python were studied and implemented. The programs demonstrated storing data in key–value form, searching, updating, and analyzing values. The DIY problems showed real-life applications like login validation and result analysis. This experiment helped in understanding how dictionaries are useful for structured data storage and retrieval.
